Spell Checker

This is a tool for checking your spellbook in project 1999 everquest.

In game, you can do 

/outputfile spellbook

This will create a file in your eq direectory, 
Charactername-Spellbook.txt 

Once you have that file, you can run this spell checker to see which spells are
missing, and usually where to obtain them.

By default, the tool will run against all spellbook files in the current directory.

Use python spellbook_checker.py --help to see command line options.
